## Overview

This documentation provides instructions for Adobe Connect Custom Pods SDK Documentation v11. For working with Cat Analytics APIs, see [Cat Analytics API Documentation](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/dev-site).

Custom pods can be used to allow multi-user interactions within a session, they can provide a synchronized display of information for all users and can even send and receive data from external websites. Simple examples include a countdown-timer that lets a host show everyone when the meeting will start, or an interactive game that displays a leaderboard with all the participantsâ€™ scores, or a map application that combines user location data with map data from an external mapping website.
