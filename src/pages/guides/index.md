# Overview

The Adobe Connect SDK provides developers with the tools to integrate and extend the capabilities of Adobe Connect. Developers can create applications using standard HTML and JavaScript programming. The SDK is a javascript library which provides a set of standard programming interfaces (Methods, Events, Properties, and Constants).  

## What are custom pods?

Adobe Connect custom pods are third-party applications that extend the functionality of Adobe Connect virtual meeting rooms. These custom pods can be added to enhance interactivity and provide specialized tools that standard pods may not offer. 

Custom pods can be used to allow multi-user interactions within a session, they can provide a synchronized display of information for all users and can even send and receive data from external websites. Simple examples include a countdown-timer that lets a host show everyone when the meeting will start, or an interactive game that displays a leaderboard with all the participantsâ€™ scores, or a map application that combines user location data with map data from an external mapping website. 

The developer of a custom pod might want choose which variables are synchronized for all users in the meeting (such as the countdown timer value), or to limit the permissions to view certain UI elements or enter data in a field (so only hosts can set the time in the countdown), or even to change the behavior of a custom pod when it is being viewed in a recording.
