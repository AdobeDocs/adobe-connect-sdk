# Listing Details

Add details of your listing like Custom Pod name, media details, categories, and legal information. 

The developer can navigate to the “Listing details” page to add listing-level metadata details that help users discover their listing in the marketplace once it’s published.

This is the landing page to create a submission. Note the following items for Adobe Connect Custom Pod listings:

1. The navigation panel on the left confirms that this is the Listing Details screen.
2. The developer's role and organization name are listed in the upper right-hand corner. If any profile details need to be edited, click the "Edit Profile" tab.
3. The menu at the top of the screen indicates the listing status, the platform, the last modified date, and the Pod ID. The listing details for the app are ready to be added now.

Once details are added to the General tab, the developer can move onto the media tab to add details like Custom Pod icon and screenshots.
