# Version Details

Learn about how to add version details for your Custom pod.

Adobe Connect custom pod requires a package to be uploaded and validated before the developer can submit the listing for Adobe’s review. The developer will see the option to '**Add new version**' in the left navigation bar. Clicking on ‘Add new version’ creates a new version and takes the developer to the '**Version Details**' page.
