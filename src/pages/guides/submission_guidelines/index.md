# Submission Guidelines

Learn how to create and submit your Custom Pod from Developer Distribution.

Third-party developers can register on <a href="https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/">Developer Distribution</a> and start submitting their Custom Pods, if they wish for these Custom Pods to become available in the in-app Custom Pods marketplace. Developer Distribuition allows developers to add details of their Custom Pods, metadata, and pod packages.   

Once submitted, Adobe reviewers will review the submission. Depending on the details provided by the developer, and on the basis of review guidelines, reviewers will either approve the Custom Pod submission, or ask for more details from the developer.
